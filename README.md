# My DSA Learning Journey with Striver's SDE Sheet

## Introduction

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Debasish Das, and I've embarked on a 30-day journey to conquer Data Structures and Algorithms using Striver's SDE Sheet. This repository serves as a log of my progress, where I document my daily problem-solving adventure and commit my code to GitHub.

## Why Striver's SDE Sheet?

I chose Striver's SDE Sheet because it's a comprehensive resource covering top coding interview questions from various DSA topics. With the promise of in-depth solutions, well-structured articles, and a supportive community, I'm excited to enhance my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Daily Updates

### Day 1: Arrays
- Completed 6 problems related to arrays.
- Explored brute force, better, and optimal solutions.
- Added C++ code for each problem.
- Commited and pushed to GitHub: [Day 1 - Arrays](https://github.com/Unstable108/Striver-SDE-Sheet-30-Days/tree/main/Day%201)

### Day 2: Arrays Part-II
- Planned and solved 6 additional array problems.
- Dived into more complex scenarios and edge cases.
- Committed code changes: [Day 2 - Arrays Part-II](Link to Day 2 GitHub commit)


## About My Approach

- **Daily Commitment:** I commit to solving a set of problems each day to stay consistent.
  
- **Language Choice:** I've opted for C++, and I'm maintaining the codebase using clean and readable code.

- **Learning from Solutions:** I not only solve problems but also learn from the provided solutions. Understanding different approaches enhances my problem-solving skills.

- **GitHub Repository:** My progress is visible on [My GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Unstable108/Striver-SDE-Sheet-30-Days), where you can explore the code, commit history, and track my journey.

## Road Ahead

I'm excited about the learning journey ahead. Each day brings new challenges and opportunities for growth. If you have any suggestions, feel free to drop a comment or reach out.

Stay tuned for daily updates as I conquer Striver's SDE Sheet one problem at a time!

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
